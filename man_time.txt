DESCRIPTION
    Time returns the long integer value of the system date and time and,
if its argument is non-zero, places this value in the long integer
pointed to by 'tp'.

    Ftime gives more information by filling in a structure defined in
    the header file1as follows:

    /* 'ftime' structure */
    struct timeb {
        long time ; /* time in seconds */
        char tm_tik ; /* ticks in second (tenths) */
        int timezone ; /* time zone */
        char dstflag ; /* daylight savings flag */
    };

'Timezone' is the number of minutes west of Greenwich.
